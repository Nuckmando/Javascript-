    <h1>Scene 5 Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Scene 5 shows how to make two separate BabylonJS scenes and switch between them.
        This scene was created to demonstrate scene management,
        GUI buttons and basic BabylonJS setup.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Scene Does</h2>
    <p>
        I created two simple scenes. One is a small forest area and the other one is a lava cave.
        A button is displayed at the top of the screen. When the user clicks the button,
        the scene changes. The button switches between Scene 1 and Scene 2.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        The BabylonJS engine is created once. I made two functions: one to build the forest scene
        and one to build the lava scene. Each function returns a normal BabylonJS scene.
        A variable called “currentScene” stores whichever scene is active.
    </p>

    <p>
        The button is made with BabylonJS GUI. When it is pressed, the button changes the value
        of “currentScene”. The render loop always draws the scene that is currently selected.
    </p>

    <h2>Assets Used</h2>
    <p>
        I used simple shapes and colours for this scene. The ground in the forest scene uses
        the floor texture from the coursework texture folder. The lava scene uses emissive colours.
        No external 3D models were used.
